- 👋 Hi, I’m Phil
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science and Data Science, with a focus on their applications in the Social Sciences (Especially Economics and Sociology)
- ✨ I generally enjoy working on Python (it's really versatile in my opinion).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on learning more ML - and doing more data analysis.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me at pkw2010@nyu.edu :)

I've historically not been that active at updating my Github (instead periodically uploading stuff I've done), but I'll try to update it more often.

Thanks! Have a great day!

- 👍 I also use R and STATA for DS and know a bit of C++, JS and Java.
