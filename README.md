- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Phil
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science and Data Science, with a focus on their applications on the Social Sciences (Especially Economics and Sociology)
- âœ¨ I generally enjoy working on Python (it's really versatile in my opinion), but I know a bit of R and STATA for data analysis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more ML - and trying to work more on web dev
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach me at pkw2010@nyu.edu :)
