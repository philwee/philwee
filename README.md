- 👋 Hi, I’m Phil
- ✨ I generally enjoy working on Python (it's really versatile in my opinion).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on learning more ML - and doing more data analysis.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me at philwee@nyu.edu :)

I've historically not been that active at updating my Github (instead periodically uploading stuff I've done), but I'll try to update it more often.

Thanks! Have a great day!
